# CompTIA notes

These notes are basically my notes focusing on areas in which I need further study.  These are neither complete nor are they intended to provide a broad overview of concepts.  

Note:  Question marks are areas where I intend to go back and fill in more data (I do this so that I can CTRL+F and find the question marks, then fill it in)
